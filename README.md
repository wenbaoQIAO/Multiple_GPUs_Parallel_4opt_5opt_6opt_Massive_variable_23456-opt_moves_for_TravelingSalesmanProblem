# Multiple_GPUs_Parallel_4opt_5opt_6opt_Massive_variable_23456-opt_moves_for_TravelingSalesmanProblem
The 2-opt, 3-opt, 4-opt, 5-opt, and 6-opt are classical k-opt local search algorithms for the travelling salesman problem (TSP) in combinatorial optimisation. However, these algorithms exhibit two limitations. Firstly, serial execution of these algorithms results in polynomial time complexity, which imposes significant computational burdens for large-scale TSP instances. Secondly, k needs to be specified in advance. To address the first limitation, some researchers have exploited GPU parallelisation to develop GPU-parallel 2-opt and 3-opt algorithms. For the second limitation, some researchers have proposed variable lambda-opt algorithms. Notably, the extant literature exhibits a paucity of research concerning the GPU-accelerated computation of 4-opt, 5-opt, 6-opt, and variable lambda-opt methodologies. This paper presents parallel implementations of complete 4-opt, 5-opt, 6-opt, and variable lambda-opt (lambda = 2,3,4,5,6) search algorithms, which are designed for execution across multiple GPUs. These parallel implementations adhere to data-parallel and support seamless deployment across an arbitrary number of GPUs. Additionally, this paper presents a serial algorithm that executes multiple variable lambda-opt moves on the same TSP tour. The source code is publicly available, and evaluations of these GPU-parallel k-opt algorithms were conducted on standard TSP benchmark instances without incorporating nearest-neighbour information. Experimental tests on 12 TSP instances show that the proposed method exhibits the shortest computational time per iteration during complete 4-opt, 5-opt, 6-opt and variable lambda-opt search applied to a global TSP tour while refining a near-optimal solution. For example, the single-GPU-parallel implementation of the complete 4-opt search runs over 1280 times faster than its serial counterpart (135.1 s vs >48 h) for mu1979.tsp. This exceptional speedup leads to the fastest implementation method for optimising a brute-force TSP tour through variable complete lambda-opt search applied to the global tour. For example, the single-GPU-parallel increasing variable lambda-optimal (lambda = 2,3,4) method runs more than 58 times faster than its serial version (0.8312 h vs >48 h). Moreover, given a sufficient number of GPUs, further computational acceleration can be achieved, enabling the determination of 5-optimal and 6-optimal TSP tours within acceptable timeframes.
